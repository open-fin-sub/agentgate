# AgentGate Refactor-1 Implementation Plan

Current implementation status is tracked in
[`project-progress.md`](project-progress.md). This document remains the migration and
sequencing authority rather than a claim that every target file already exists.

## 1. Scope And Authority

This plan reorganizes the working behavior on Git branch `goal/p1-demo` into the
architecture defined by [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

```text
goal/p1-demo                         refactor-1
working P1 demo behavior  ->  maintainable AgentGate structure
```

`integration/p1-new` is a team member's independent implementation. It is review input
only and is not the base of this refactor. Before implementing each file, inspect its
relevant code for behavior or implementation that fits the approved refactor contract.
Do not merge the branch or adopt conflicting architecture wholesale.

Authority order:

1. `docs/product-requirements-zh.md`: required product behavior.
2. `docs/architecture.md`: target structure and dependency direction.
3. `docs/architecture-review-ledger.md`: detailed architecture decisions.
4. `goal/p1-demo` code and tests: inherited behavior that must be preserved.
5. Empty scaffold files carry no architectural authority.

## 2. Refactor Rules

1. Refactor structure before adding product features.
2. Preserve P1 business behavior, but do not preserve old Python, JSON, API, or persisted schemas.
3. Move tests with behavior and leave the suite passing after each phase.
4. Do not maintain old and new domain models in parallel.
5. Do not move empty scaffold modules into the new structure.
6. Do not mix `integration/p1-new` work into refactor commits.
7. Preserve existing uncommitted Web work and reconcile it during the Web phase.
8. Add dependencies and modules only for behavior that is actually implemented.
9. Write source code, identifiers, comments, tests, active documentation, and
   application-owned UI text in English. External customer data and imported Dataset
   content may retain their source language.

### Engineering Philosophy

Use Unix-style components with one responsibility, explicit inputs and outputs, and
composition as the default reuse mechanism. Domain models are immutable data with local
invariants; execution behavior is assembled from small functions and boundary protocols.
Avoid concrete inheritance hierarchies and speculative factories, registries, plugin
systems, event buses, or service wrappers. A new abstraction must represent a real shared
contract, invariant, lifecycle, or at least two exercised implementations.

### Approval Checkpoints

Apply the following sequence separately to each package and file:

1. Confirm folder and Python filenames without changing class or function design.
2. Review one file's responsibility and ownership, then obtain user confirmation.
3. Review that file's classes, functions, protocols, relationships, invariants, and
   dependencies, then obtain user confirmation.
4. Present an implementation-source assessment before coding:
   - `goal/p1-demo`: identify behavior or code to reuse, adapt, or reject;
   - `integration/p1-new`: identify behavior or code to reuse, adapt, or reject;
   - from scratch: identify the code required because neither source fits.
   "Reuse" is not permission to copy code wholesale. Separate the assessment into
   behavior to preserve, code safe to reuse directly, code requiring adaptation or
   rewrite, and code to reject. Check responsibility, current domain compatibility,
   coding style, error and security behavior, dependencies, and tests before deciding.
   Stop and obtain explicit user approval after presenting this assessment.
5. Implement only the confirmed design, add focused tests, and show verification before
   moving to the next file.

Do not combine checkpoints. A naming review must not silently become an implementation,
and file-level design and implementation proceed one file at a time.

Actions used below:

- **Keep:** retain responsibility and behavior.
- **Rename/Move:** retain behavior under the confirmed boundary.
- **Split:** separate mixed responsibilities.
- **Merge:** fold a small helper into its owner.
- **Remove:** delete obsolete, duplicate, or empty scaffolding after references are gone.
- **Defer:** document the boundary without implementing it in this refactor.

## 3. Baseline Behavior To Preserve

- Dataset draft, edit, copy, reorder, publish, archive, import, and export workflows.
- Immutable Dataset versions and reproducible Run manifests.
- Published-Dataset and evaluator preflight validation.
- Deterministic loan demo with a failing risky version and passing fixed version.
- Per-turn evaluator execution, dependencies, memoization, and error Results.
- Existing deterministic Rule evaluators and failure attribution.
- Metric aggregation, release-gate decision, and Run report.
- SQLite persistence for Datasets, Runs, Traces, Results, and demo business state.
- OTLP/HTTP ingestion and canonical Trace conversion.
- FastAPI, CLI, and Web paths for running the demo and reading results.

Before structural edits, run the complete baseline suite and record the command and
result.

## 4. Backend File Map

### Domain

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domain/base.py` | Keep | `domain/base.py` |
| `domain/case.py` | Split | `domain/case.py` for individual Cases; `domain/dataset.py` for Dataset aggregates and versions |
| `domain/expectation.py` | Keep | `domain/expectation.py` |
| `domain/evaluation.py` | Rename | `domain/evaluator.py` |
| `domain/run.py` | Split/expand | `domain/run.py`, `domain/target.py`; replace `RunSnapshot` with `RunManifest` |
| `domain/trace.py` | Keep/expand | `domain/trace.py` |
| `domain/result.py` | Keep | `domain/result.py` |
| `domain/metric.py` | Keep | `domain/metric.py` |
| `domain/gate.py` | Keep | `domain/gate.py` |
| `domain/report.py` | Keep | `domain/report.py` |
| none | Add | `domain/artifact.py`, `domain/skill_analysis.py` |

`domain/__init__.py` is updated last so it exports only the confirmed public API.

### Dataset

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case/import_export.py` | Split | `dataset/loader.py`, `dataset/export.py`, `dataset/formats/json.py` |
| `case/service.py` | Move/split | `application/dataset_management.py`, `dataset/versioning.py` |
| `case/validation.py` | Split/remove | Case invariants in `domain/case.py`; Dataset invariants in `domain/dataset.py`; workflow/preflight checks in application |
| empty `case/customer/` | Remove | Recreate only for a real customer format |
| empty `case/public_benchmarks/` | Remove/defer | Add benchmark adapters only when implemented |
| none | Add when needed | `dataset/sampling.py` and implemented files under `dataset/formats/` |
| none | Defer | `dataset/generation/` |

### Evaluator

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `evaluator/base.py` | Rename | `evaluator/evaluator_protocol.py` |
| `evaluator/runner.py` | Rename/adapt | `evaluator/executor.py` |
| `evaluator/models.py` | Keep | `evaluator/models.py` |
| `evaluator/calc_score.py` | Merge | Private executor/rule finalization behavior |
| `evaluator/observations.py` | Move | `evaluator/rule/observations.py` |
| `evaluator/operators/` | Move | `evaluator/rule/operators.py` |
| `evaluator/rules/*.py` | Move | `evaluator/rule/*.py` |
| `evaluator/registry.py` | Remove after adaptation | Explicit composition in `application/evaluator_management.py` |
| `evaluator/validation.py` | Split | Spec invariants in domain; selected-plan and configured JSON Schema preflight in application |
| `evaluator/hybrid/README.md` | Replace when implemented | `evaluator/hybrid.py` |
| `evaluator/llm_judge/README.md` | Replace | `evaluator/judge/` for case-scoped semantic answer-quality evaluation |
| empty `evaluator/external/` | Remove | Real provider adapters belong in `integrations/model_providers/` |
| none | Add | `evaluator/rule/json_schema.py` for safe Draft 2020-12 validation |
| none | Add | `integrations/model_providers/openai_compatible.py` for preconfigured Chat Completions transport |
| none | Add | `integrations/model_providers/environment.py` for one optional POC Judge connection |

Preserve per-turn checks, dependency resolution, memoization, evaluator version checks,
sanitized errors, and independent error Results while removing global registration.

Rule and Hybrid evaluators remain turn-scoped. LLM Judge evaluators execute once per
complete Case, receive redacted bounded evidence, use provider-neutral model contracts,
and return strict verdicts with request provenance. The OpenAI-compatible adapter accepts
only deployment-configured endpoints and already-resolved credentials. The POC environment
loader requires provider ID, HTTPS base URL, API key, and model ID together; all four absent
preserves the Rule-only catalog. The API uses that configuration to include the immutable
`answer-quality` specification in a Run manifest, and Celery reconstructs its runtime
implementation from identical worker configuration. API and task lifecycles close their
own model clients. Plaintext credentials never enter `EvaluatorSpec` or persisted manifests.

Persistent provider records, managed production credential resolution, provider-management
APIs, tenant isolation, and Web provider settings remain separate unfinished capabilities.

`MatchesJsonSchema` resolves through the explicit `matches_json_schema@1` Rule operator.
`evaluator/rule/json_schema.py` owns schema and structured-instance validation, while
`application/evaluator_management.py` rejects invalid schemas before Run persistence. A
missing `$schema` selects Draft 2020-12. Only `#` and local JSON Pointer references are
accepted; remote, file, relative-document, anchor, and dynamic references are rejected.
Runtime violation reasons identify only the instance path and failing keyword, never the
actual value.

### Trace And Run

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace/normalizer.py` | Keep | `trace/normalizer.py` |
| `trace/receivers/otlp_http.py` | Move | `integrations/observability/otlp_http_receiver.py` |
| empty Trace importers/adapters/graph/evidence/models | Remove | Add only for real integrations or analysis needs |
| none | Add | `trace/redaction.py` |
| `run/core.py` | Split | `run/engine.py`, `run/target_protocol.py`, `integrations/targets/demo_loan.py` |
| `run/core.py:LocalScheduler` | Remove | Direct application call or real job dispatcher |
| `run/core.py:ExternalSchedulerAdapter` | Redefine | Application/job-dispatch boundary at whole-Run level |
| empty `run/snapshot.py` | Remove | `domain.RunManifest` already owns the complete contract |
| empty `run/lifecycle.py`, `run/models.py`, `run/scheduler.py` | Remove | Responsibilities already belong to domain/application/integrations |
| empty `run/targets/`, `run/external/` | Remove/recreate | Real adapters under `integrations/targets/` |
| none | Add when exercised | `run/process_manager.py`, `run/retry.py`, `run/artifacts.py` |

### Result

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `result/calc_metrics.py` | Rename | `result/metrics.py` |
| `result/gate.py` | Keep | `result/gate.py` |
| `result/service.py` | Rename | `result/report.py` |
| empty `result/compare.py` | Remove/recreate | `result/comparison.py` when comparison is implemented |
| empty `result/export/` | Remove | Real external outputs belong in integrations |

### Application, Storage, Server, CLI, And Demo

| P1 source | Action | Refactor-1 destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control_plane/service.py` | Split/remove | Capability-oriented modules under `application/` |
| `storage/base.py` | Rename/expand | `storage/repository.py` |
| `storage/sqlite.py` | Keep/refactor | `storage/sqlite.py` with indexed manifest asset references |
| none | Add when Artifact exists | `storage/artifacts.py` |
| `server/application.py` | Split | `server/app.py`, dependencies, errors, and `server/routes/*.py` |
| `cli/application.py` | Split | `cli/main.py`, `run_commands.py`, `dataset_commands.py`, `result_commands.py` |
| `demo/loan.py`, `demo/provider.py` | Move | `examples/loan_approval/` |

Application destinations are `run_management.py`, `dataset_management.py`,
`target_catalog.py`, `evaluator_management.py`, `result_reader.py`, and
`lineage_queries.py`. Server and CLI must call these shared use cases.

### Removed Or Deferred Top-Level Packages

| P1 package | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| `experiment/` | Remove one-line placeholders; introduce focused `ab_test/` only when needed. |
| `lineage/` | Remove placeholders; use RunManifest references, indexes, and lineage queries. |
| `queue/` | Remove placeholders; use a real job dispatcher integration. |
| `optimizer/` | Retain as a documented future boundary; defer implementation design. |
| `control_plane/` | Remove after its use cases move to `application/`. |

## 5. Web Refactor Map

The Web phase starts from `goal/p1-demo` behavior plus the current uncommitted Web work.
Those changes must be incorporated rather than overwritten.

| Current area | Action | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| broad `App.vue` workflow/navigation | Split | `layouts/AppLayout.vue`, router, and capability pages |
| manual navigation | Replace | `router/index.ts` using Vue Router |
| Dataset UI | Keep/adapt | Dataset page, components, and `useDatasetWorkspace.ts` |
| launch/progress UI | Split | Run page, components, and `useRunProgress.ts` |
| overview/result UI | Split | Overview, Result Center, and Result Detail pages |
| broad API client | Split | Transport client plus capability API modules |
| Dataset-only API types | Split/expand | Capability contracts under `types/` |
| global styles | Keep/reconcile | Tokens, base rules, and scoped feature styles |
| static Skill analysis | Add after backend contract | Skill Analysis page, components, and API |
| optimizer UI | Defer | Add only with a real backend use case |

The seven planned POC routes remain those defined in [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

## 6. Implementation Phases

Current phase status:

- Phases 0-2: complete.
- Phase 3: complete; Evaluator structure, Result behavior, Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema Rules,
  case-level Judge execution, and the OpenAI-compatible provider transport are aligned.
- Phase 4: complete; Trace protection, Target and Run boundaries, persistence,
  asynchronous dispatch, and legacy cleanup are aligned.
- Phase 5: complete; FastAPI, CLI, and workers use Application services, API/worker Judge
  composition and model-client lifecycles are wired, and the legacy Control Plane is
  removed.
- Phase 6: the asynchronous Run vertical slice and desktop/mobile workflow are complete;
  final Router/layout and remaining planned pages are pending.
- Phase 7: pending.

### Phase 0: Record Baseline

- Create `refactor-1` from `goal/p1-demo` without losing unrelated working-tree changes.
- Run and record backend and Web baseline tests.
- Mark tests that depend on obsolete import paths.

Gate: risky/fixed demo, Dataset workflow, OTLP, API, CLI, and Web behavior have a recorded baseline.

### Phase 1: Domain

- Finalize domain modules, invariants, versions, manifests, and public exports.
- Add focused domain and serialization tests.

Gate: domain has no feature/infrastructure imports; immutability and hash round trips pass.

### Phase 2: Storage And Dataset

- Align repository/SQLite boundaries.
- Separate Dataset mechanics, formats, and application workflows.
- Follow `docs/storage/implementation-plan.md` and
  `docs/dataset/implementation-plan.md` for the approved file-level order and completion
  gates.

Gate: Dataset and repository tests pass through the new boundaries.

### Phase 3: Evaluator And Result

- Establish Evaluator protocol, explicit composition, executor, rules, and runtime models.
- Align Metrics, Gate, Report, and Comparison modules.

Gate: risky/fixed Result counts, scores, attribution, and Gate conclusions match baseline.

### Phase 4: Trace, Target, And Run

- Separate RunEngine, application composition, Target Adapter Protocol, adapters, and
  OTLP handling.
- Add redaction; add process/retry/artifact modules only with exercised behavior.

Gate: an end-to-end Run persists its exact manifest, Traces, Results, Metrics, Gate, and Report.

### Phase 5: Application, Server, And CLI

- Replace `control_plane/` with application use cases.
- Split FastAPI and CLI transports around those shared use cases.

Gate: API and CLI produce equivalent persisted results without direct evaluation or SQL logic.

### Phase 6: Web

- Reconcile existing Web changes and split routing, layout, pages, components, state, APIs, and types.
- Connect the planned POC pages to real FastAPI responses as they are implemented.

Gate: typecheck, unit tests, build, and desktop/mobile Playwright workflows pass.

### Phase 7: Cleanup

- Remove empty scaffolds, obsolete imports, stale dependencies, and generated caches.
- Run boundary checks and complete backend/Web suites.
- Compare final demo output with the Phase 0 baseline.

Gate: no duplicate domain models or obsolete packages remain and all acceptance tests pass.

## 7. Commit Order

```text
refactor(domain)
refactor(storage)
refactor(dataset)
refactor(evaluator)
refactor(result)
refactor(run)
refactor(application)
refactor(server)
refactor(cli)
refactor(web)
chore(cleanup)
```

Each commit must be independently reviewable and must not include team branch features.

## 8. Team Branch Review After Refactor

After refactor-1 passes all gates, review `integration/p1-new` using:

```text
Capability | Needed behavior | Test quality | Architectural fit | Port/reimplement/reject
```

Potential candidates include JSON Schema evaluation, Excel handling, HTTP Target
execution, Trace correlation, single-Case rerun, regression workflows, and selected Web
components. This later review does not change the refactor baseline.

## 2026-10-06 历史智能体目录接入

沿用当前恢复分支的 TargetDescriptor、local_bank / demo_loan 执行适配器，以及平台目录；不改历史快照。行外 localAgentDirectory 组合平台目录与本地目录，行内 agentDirectory 保持原网关及 token。选择器传递明确的本地执行类型与真实描述符，贷款云虾不虚构平台分支。任务提交按适配器分流；标注和测评集关联按真实 source/id/version 匹配历史。复用既有三种贷款 LiveModel 服务和内置双版本 Demo，不新增模拟实现。验收覆盖目录、提交、标注匹配、真实执行和 Trace。

本地目录接入补充验收：三种贷款模式已切换 DeepSeek v4 Pro（非思考模式），6 条真实模型样本/9 轮调用完成，Trace 及评分验证通过。使用原有 LiveModel/HTTP/SDK 边界，仅增加显式 thinking 配置和协议字段保留。详情见 project-progress.md 的 2026-10-06 DeepSeek 验收记录。


## 2026-10-06 贷款云虾 LLM 评估器配置

直接复用当前 answer_quality / full_trajectory / Evaluator Catalog 发布契约，以配置完成贷款回答可信度与审批解释评估，不新增模块、协议或模型路由层。当前发布评估器 113ee56f-3136-4d7d-9b43-ab47dfaeea06 v3；评分标准包含脱敏证据边界和正反归因锚点，7类真实模型校准均符合预期。默认模型连接在本地预览启动配置中切换为DeepSeek v4 Pro；行内/行外目录和token分流不变。逐版本校准和完整测评验收详情见 project-progress.md。


## 2026-10-06 Skill 静态分析恢复接入

复用现有 TaskStaticAnalysis / UpstreamAnalysis 与 skill_analysis 接口，在当前任务结果页开放入口；新建行外本地目标任务使用真实描述符预先分析并保存关联。任务报告按运行描述符锁定，登录模式目录分流不变；行内尚未执行的目录目标不使用本地 Demo 代替。保留描述分析与动态评估的边界，未扩大到代码审查或 Prompt-Tool 一致性。真实模型与回归结果见 project-progress.md。


## 2026-10-07 贷款工作流图谱

完成已确认的 runtime.py → app.py → local_bank.py → TargetStructure.vue 链路：共用执行图导出、接口传递、校验固定快照、按有向层级展示。基础编排和Skill结构复用既有声明；历史快照不回填，行内/行外路由不改变。用户在页面文件阶段授权直接完成后续实施与验收。详情见project-progress.md。


## 2026-10-07 三类贷款核心专项验收

用户授权直接实施至可验收。当前分支复用多轮领域、规则/LLM/composite执行与版本发布；新增单一职责 execution_path evaluator，适配器只规范化实际SDK类型，UI保存与导出保留新断言。未修改目录/Token模式路由、未新增调度或注册框架、未改变默认内置评估器集合。goal/p1-demo、integration/p1-new本地不可解析，因此未声称复用其具体代码。共3集v2、24样本、9任务真实完成，工作流7节点10连线、云虾3 Skills覆盖。回归1380后端/82前端通过，最终结果67/72通过，5条真实原因解释失败保留，详见project-progress.md。
